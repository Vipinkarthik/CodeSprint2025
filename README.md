Harassment Detector

Our project integrates AI with existing CCTV systems to detect threats or sexual assaults against women in public spaces. By analyzing video feeds in real time, the system identifies incidents, alerts the control room, and facilitates swift police intervention to prevent situations getting worse.

Incidents of sexual assault and threats to women's safety in public spaces often go unnoticed due to the lack of proactive surveillance and timely intervention. Existing CCTV systems are underutilized, primarily serving as evidence rather than tools for real-time threat detection and prevention.
